Operating System Function: User Interface
A computer's operating system determines the inteface, the manner in which the user interacts with
the computer. It provides one or more methods for the user to provide the computer with input, and
for the computer to return output to the user. The user may click on images with a mouse button,
or type commands into a keyboard, or press their finger against a touch-screen, while the computer
will display text on a monitor, which may or may not be accompanied by images.

Operating System Function: Memory Management
The operating system is responsible for organizing the computer's memory, dividing it up between
various instructions and data in the most efficient manner possible, so that it can most effectively
follow those instructions and interpret that data. This may include assigning some of the open space
on the hard drive to become a "swap file", temporarily acting as additional memory when the computer's
resources are exceeded by the user's demands.
