Operating System Function: User Interface
A computer's operating system determines the inteface, the manner in which the user interacts with
the computer. It provides one or more methods for the user to provide the computer with input, and
for the computer to return output to the user. The user may click on images with a mouse button,
or type commands into a keyboard, or press their finger against a touch-screen, while the computer
will display text on a monitor, which may or may not be accompanied by images.
